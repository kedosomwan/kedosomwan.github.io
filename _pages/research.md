# Research Agenda

Inspired by Black Feminist Though and my own experiences as a student and teacher in K-12 schools, I analyze educational inequities and opportunity gaps caused by inequitable access to rigorous coursework and disciplinary disparities. I hypothesize and research on how these issues are worsened by ability grouping that reinforces social inequities based on race and class.

# Dissertation
My dissertation will create and validate a survey instrument measuring the constructs of (1) parents’ self-efficacy about their child’s ELA (English Language Arts) and mathematics placement decisions and (2) opportunity hoarding. Districts, schools, researchers, and advocacy groups alike will be able to use this instrument to plan parent interventions that increase advanced course taking for marginalized students. More details about the research questions and timeline can be found on [here](https://kedosomwan.github.io/dissertation).
