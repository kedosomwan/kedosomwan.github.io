# Research Agenda

Inspired by Black Feminist Though and my own experiences as a student and teacher in K-12 schools, I analyze educational inequities and opportunity gaps caused by inequitable access to rigorous coursework and disciplinary disparities. I hypothesize and research on how these issues are worsened by ability grouping that reinforces social inequities based on race and class.

# Dissertation
* My dissertation will validate a survey instrument measuring the constructs of (1) parents’ self-efficacy about their child’s ELA (English Language Arts) and mathematics placement decisions and (2) opportunity hoarding. 
* Districts, schools, researchers, and advocacy groups alike can use this to plan parent interventions that increase advanced course taking for marginalized students. 
* This will contribute to educational equity because Black, Latinx, emergent bilingual, and low-SES students are all at an opportunity disadvantage to be enrolled in high track classes, and understanding the role of parent demographics and opportunity hoarding in student tracking placement is crucial for promoting educational equity and closing opportunity gaps for children who come from traditionally marginalized demographic groups historically and currently stratified into lower tracks.


## Dissertation Research Questions
1. What is the underlying factor structure of parents’ self-efficacy in their child’s tracking enrollment?
2. What is the underlying factor structure of parents’ opportunity hoarding regarding tracking practices?
3. How do different dimensions of parental self-efficacy relate to their child’s enrollment ELA and mathematics classes?
4. What factors contribute to parents’ behaviors of opportunity hoarding in the context of their children’s ELA and Mathematics ?

## Mathematics mobility in the middle grades: Tracking the odds of completing calculus

<p style="padding-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;"> Edosomwan, K., Young, J.R., & Tholen, A. (2022). Mathematics mobility in the middle grades: Tracking the odds of completing calculus. <i>Middle Grades Review, 8</i>(1), 1-17. <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1357744">https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1357744</a></p>

- Using a logistic regression analysis of the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09), this paper discovered students who took early Algebra I in middle school had significantly greater odds of taking calculus in high school compared to those who did not. These correlations varied across racial groups, with Black and Latinx students being more likely to fall off the track to high school calculus and Asian students having higher likelihood of entering the track. 

- This was my first published article! Based on my own experience with having access to advanced mathematics based on my middle school Algebra I background, I wanted to see if similar correlations were visible in national data. During the 2021 Snowpocalyse that hit Texas, I had no power for three days and with no internet, chose to work on learning R programming to answer my question while walking to the laundry room to charge my computer periodically. I really grew with this project, going from individually calculating each odds ratio to learning how to account for other variables by finding odds ratios through logistic regression. I fell in love with using R though R studio and became (in my opinion) a self-taught R guru, although over the years I discovered better ways to run and present the results of similar analyses.


## Tracking the effects: Examining the opportunity stratification hypothesis in action

- Using a logistic regression analysis of the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:02), this paper discovered a strong negative correlation between being in non-college preparatory academic programs and experiencing exclusionary discipline. Based on those results, we discuss how both tracking and exclusionary discipline serve as ways to limit opportunity for students who are already disadvantaged by the system by race and socioeconomic status.

- This was my first full research project and very dear to my heart! Reading this gives you a very good representation of my views as a scholar of educational equity. As a teacher and student, I often noticed that teachers treated students in advanced classes better. We were less likely to get in trouble and often given grace when we misbehaved. My question was, was there a correlation between advanced coursework and disciplinary outcomes? I ran the analysis and wrote up the first draft in my first year as a PhD student before presenting it to my chair for feedback. The professors on the project gave feedback, helped outline the literature review, gave advice on a proper theoretical framework, and helped with the recommendations and implications based on their expertise as consultants in schools. This is really the paper that taught me the research and publication process.

## Double Jeopardy? Examining the influence of mathematics tracking on in-school suspensions through an intersectionality framework

<p style="padding-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Edosomwan, K. & Williams III, J.A. (2023). Double Jeopardy? Examining the influence of mathematics tracking on in-school suspensions through an intersectionality framework. *School Science and Mathematics, 1258*(2), 72-84. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ssm.12607">https://doi.org/10.1111/ssm.12607</a></p>

- In this work, we explored the correlation between in school suspension (ISS) and advanced math taking, finding that advanced math students had lowered odds of attending ISS based on a logistic regression analysis of High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09). However, our intersectional approach found those effects varied across racial/ethnic and gender groups.
- My first research project, *Tracking the Effects* in some ways answers my questions on discipline and advanced coursework. But my method and theoretical understanding at the time was limited. After taking a theory class, I wanted to apply intersectionality to that idea and include more variables according to student identity. I came up with the idea, performed the analysis, and wrote the introduction, methods, findings, and half of the literature review and discussion. Then I approached Dr. John A. Williams, an expert on school discipline, to help with that aspect of the literature review and recommendations.
- I am proud to say this work was spotlit by SIG #27

## The relationship between middle grades algebra and advanced Carnegie credits: A QuantCrit analysis.

<p style="padding-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Edosomwan, K. Young, J.L., & Young, J.R. (2024). The relationship between middle grades algebra and advanced Carnegie credits: A QuantCrit analysis. *Middle Grades Review, 10*(1), 1-10. <a href="https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/mgreview/vol10/iss1/3/">https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/mgreview/vol10/iss1/3/</a></p>

- This paper analyzes the relationship between advanced high school credits earned and when students took Algebra I through a visual analysis of confidence intervals based on aggregate data. We found that based on the High School Transcript Study data, students who took Algebra I before high school on average earned more advanced credits.
- This paper came from a question a committee member gave me for my qualifying exams based on my interest in analyzing the correlations between tracking and student mathematics attainment. I performed the analysis and wrote the bulk of the paper. Confidence intervals are simple and fun ways to analyze data because anyone can comprehend the results and you can use publicly available data and Excel to calculate them. The visual interpretation of confidence intervals is something I learned from my chair's research that I find useful with aggregate data. Co-authors provided feedback, data, and the central research questions.
