Inspired by Black Feminist Though and my own experiences as a student and teacher in K-12 schools, I analyze educational inequities and opportunity gaps caused by inequitable access to rigourous coursework and disciplinary disparities. I hypothesize and research on how these issues are worsened by ability grouping that reinforces social inequities based on race and class. To see my list of publications, refer to my [Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9EWCrkEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
