<p>I am a doctoral candidate in Curriculum and Instruction in Texas A&M University's Department of Teaching, Learning, and Culture. My research uses critical quantitative analysis of educational inequities and opportunity gaps caused by inequitable access to rigorous coursework and disciplinary disparities. I also teach multicultural education classes for undergraduate students.</p>
