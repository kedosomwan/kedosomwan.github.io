# Impassioned by Personal Experiences
My personal experiences have shaped my academic journey and underscored the urgency of addressing racial and ethnic disparities in educational assessment. From my early encounters with the education system, where arbitrary measures threatened to dictate my academic trajectory, to my experiences as an educator witnessing the racialized nature of tracking, I have been acutely aware of the profound impact of structural discrimination. My positionality as a scholar is deeply rooted in lived experiences, a commitment to dismantling structural discrimination, and a passion for empowering parents in navigating the educational landscape. 

# K-12 Beginnings
In elementary school, my first-grade teacher tried to put me in special education, which could have limited my opportunities for academic success. Fortunately, my mother, a special education teacher, intervened and prevented this from happening. This experience highlighted the pivotal role that familial knowledge plays in navigating the educational landscape. I entered advanced classes in my middle school and graduated Clifton J. Ozen Magnet High School in Beaumont, TX as Valedictorian in 2010.

# K-12 Teaching Experience
As a teacher, I observed the persistent racial divides in tracking practices, where Latinx and African American students faced unequal opportunities. This stark reality persisted even when transitioning to a racially diverse school, emphasizing the systemic nature of these inequalities. The prejudiced perceptions educators held about students' potential and motivation based on their track placements further fueled my commitment to unraveling the complexities of educational measurement. This commitment led to my pursuit of my PhD.

# Graduate Studies and Current Focus
My graduate studies have equipped me with the theoretical framework and critical quantitative lens to scrutinize the discriminatory practices inherent in ability grouping and tracking. I aim to contribute to the field by developing and validating a survey instrument for parents. This tool can promote better communication between homes and schools and provide insights into parents' perceptions of tracking and ability grouping practices. By fostering better communication between homes and schools, I aspire to catalyze positive change and dismantle the barriers marginalized students face. \
\
I utilize a QuantCrit paradigm that aligns my commitment to critical race theory and quantitative methodologies. As a Black woman, my interest in Black Feminist Thought fuels my research agenda. My past, present and future research projects focus on the intricacies of racism's centrality in student placement, explore independent variables related to tracking, and culminate in proposing policy and praxis implications for promoting social justice.
