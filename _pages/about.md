# Personal Bio
Kristian enjoys being outside and working out. She spent two years as a Bicycle Sports Club Volunteer Ride Leader and can frequently be found jogging or walking around the neighborhood or local parks. Sometimes she even drags her husband along with her!

Her hobbies include reading, spending time with family, attending live pro-wrestling events, and playing cozy video games (Stardew Valley is a particular favorite). Being able to combine those is even better, as seen in the picture below.

Her sister even convinced her to participate in the Houston Spartan Sprint Obstacle Race in 2022 (which they ended up walking because someone (her sister) didn't train for it).
