      </p>Collaboration is one of my greatest strengths. I have collaborations with professors and peers across institutions. Many of these are me serving as a quantitative methodologist for my more qualitatively focused peers.</p>

<h2>Volunteer Quantitative Research Mentor</h2>
<p>I provide free consultations to my peers on quantitative data analysis (multiple regression, structural equation modeling) and sometimes serve as a methodologist for more complex quantitative analysis. Here are a list of conference proposals and manuscripts with me as the methodologist.</p>
<ul>
            <li>Bango, E. & <strong>Edosomwan, K.</strong> (2023, Nov 15-19). <i>Show me the Money: An Analysis of the Dissemination of Child Care and Development Funds in Texas.</i> [Conference presentation].
