- This paper analyzes the relationship between advanced high school credits earned and when students took Algebra I through a visual analysis of confidence intervals based on aggregate data. We found that based on the High School Transcript Study data, students who took Algebra I before high school on average earned more advanced credits.
- This paper came from a question a committee member gave me for my qualifying exams based on my interest in analyzing the correlations between tracking and student mathematics attainment. I performed the analysis and wrote the bulk of the paper. Confidence intervals are simple and fun ways to analyze data because anyone can comprehend the results and you can use publicly available data and Excel to calculate them. The visual interpretation of confidence intervals is something I learned from my chair's research that I find useful with aggregate data. Co-authors provided feedback, data, and the central research questions.
