- Using a logistic regression analysis of the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:02), this paper discovered a strong negative correlation between being in non-college preparatory academic programs and experiencing exclusionary discipline. Based on those results, we discuss how both tracking and exclusionary discipline serve as ways to limit opportunity for students who are already disadvantaged by the system by race and socioeconomic status.

- This was my first full research project and very dear to my heart! Reading this gives you a very good representation of my views as a scholar of educational equity. As a teacher and student, I often noticed that teachers treated students in advanced classes better. We were less likely to get in trouble and often given grace when we misbehaved. My question was, was there a correlation between advanced coursework and disciplinary outcomes? I ran the analysis and wrote up the first draft in my first year as a PhD student before presenting it to my chair for feedback. The professors on the project gave feedback, helped outline the literature review, gave advice on a proper theoretical framework, and helped with the recommendations and implications based on their expertise as consultants in schools. This is really the paper that taught me the research and publication process.
