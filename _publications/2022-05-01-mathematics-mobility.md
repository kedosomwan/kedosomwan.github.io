- Using a logistic regression analysis of the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09), this paper discovered students who took early Algebra I in middle school had significantly greater odds of taking calculus in high school compared to those who did not. These correlations varied across racial groups, with Black and Latinx students being more likely to fall off the track to high school calculus and Asian students having higher likelihood of entering the track. 

- This was my first published article! Based on my own experience with having access to advanced mathematics based on my middle school Algebra I background, I wanted to see if similar correlations were visible in national data. During the 2021 Snowpocalyse that hit Texas, I had no power for three days and with no internet, chose to work on learning R programming to answer my question while walking to the laundry room to charge my computer periodically. I really grew with this project, going from individually calculating each odds ratio to learning how to account for other variables by finding odds ratios through logistic regression. I fell in love with using R though R studio and became (in my opinion) a self-taught R guru, although over the years I discovered better ways to run and present the results of similar analyses.
