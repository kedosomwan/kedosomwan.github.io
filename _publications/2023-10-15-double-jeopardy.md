- In this work, we explored the correlation between in school suspension (ISS) and advanced math taking, finding that advanced math students had lowered odds of attending ISS based on a logistic regression analysis of High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09). However, our intersectional approach found those effects varied across racial/ethnic and gender groups.
- My first research project, now published as *Tracking the Effects* in some ways answers my questions on discipline and advanced coursework. But my method and theoretical understanding at the time was limited. After taking a theory class, I wanted to apply intersectionality to that idea and include more variables according to student identity. I came up with the idea, performed the analysis, and wrote the introduction, methods, findings, and half of the literature review and discussion. Then I approached Dr. John A. Williams, an expert on school discipline, to help with that aspect of the literature review and recommendations.
- I am proud to say this work was spotlit by SIG #27 for the Critical Examination of Race, Class and Gender!
